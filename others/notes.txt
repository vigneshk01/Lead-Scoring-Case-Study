X Education cols

Also notice that when you got the value counts of all the columns, there were a few columns in which only one value was majorly present for all the data points. These include `Do Not Call`, `Search`, `Magazine`, `Newspaper Article`, `X Education Forums`, `Newspaper`, `Digital Advertisement`, `Through Recommendations`, `Receive More Updates About Our Courses`, `Update me on Supply Chain Content`, `Get updates on DM Content`, `I agree to pay the amount through cheque`. Since practically all of the values for these variables are `No`, it's best that we drop these columns as they won't help with our analysis.

Also, the variable `What matters most to you in choosing a course` has the level `Better Career Prospects` `6528` times while the other two levels appear once twice and once respectively. So we should drop this column as well.
